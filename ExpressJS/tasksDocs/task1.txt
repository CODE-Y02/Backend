Why are we using Express JS ? Any reasons?
    to handling response , parsing request and handling routing code we write in vanilla node js is complex .

    to solve this issue we use Express it automatically set headers as per response type and also sets routes very easily

What are middlewares ?
    middlewares used to modify request and response like any kind of auth process ,etc
    middlewares are function and can be used as callback inside routes and
    by using expressApp.use(middlewareFunction)
    
What is next used for.
    middlewares used to rest modifid response 
    now in middlewareFunction we have next as args that means proceed to next middlewares or code

    note :- next send  response that set headers if we are sending response we cannot use next(); 

What is res.send used for?
    it is used to send response in middlewares

If i do res.send('<h1> hello to node js </h1>') . What will be the content-type header equal to.
    it shoud be text/html , but i think theres some bug in lagest express we need to send html first otherwise it will not set content type amd gives status code 304 


If I do res.send( { key1: value }) . What will be the content-type header equal to.
    its application/json 
    its most common type of response used in software dev after text 


What does app.listen(3000) do behind the scenes ?
    it crestes server and with app as callback and set listen for server to given port

    server = http.createServer(app);
    server.listen(3000);

    where did it get http > its already imported in express by default
