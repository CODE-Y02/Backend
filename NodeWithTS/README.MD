# NODEJS WITH TYPESCRIPT

## Why do we need to install types/node? What does it do?

> TS by default uses JS not NodeJS , or React or Anything Like that

> To use Node js syntax and tell TS compiler that we are using it for Node js application

> It enable us to use require or import node js packages and write backend code in TS

    modules inside @types doesnot have complete translation of its corresponding js package ,
    It just contains instruction to check whether current TS can be translated into JS code

## Why do we need to install types/express? What does it do?

> for same reason like @types/node , TS don't know that we are using express and what its syntax

> It's npm package that enable us to use express in TS files
