Explain how does the internet work in your own words
    internet is just a collection of computers sending and receiving data from each other ;
    for ex: -> when we type google.com on browser your pc will send request assume like post deliver by postman and receiver name is google.com 
    now postman will go to address of google i.e IP address.
    then google will send response to your post based on certain condidits or by doing some task , now postman will go to your address and tell you response of google;

    this is how internet works you can only see response send by google you cannot see what operations he has performed 

What are the core modules of node js?
    core modules are functionality of node that is hidden by default those modules provieds more functionality to us , we cannot use core modules directly but we can import them as they required using "require("module-name")"

Explain the use of each one of them in detail.
    http --> 	http module includes classes, methods   and events to create Node.js http server.

    url  -->  url module includes methods for URL resolution and parsing.

    path --> path module includes methods to deal with file paths.

    fs --> fs module includes classes, methods, and events to work with file I/O.

    os -->  provides information about the operating system.

    assets --> set of assertion functions useful for testing.

    process --> provides information and control about the current Node.js process.

    querystring --> utility used for parsing and formatting URL query strings.


What are relative path and absolute path? How to define them?
     lets say my current working direcotery is 
     c:/desktop/sharpnener/backend

     i want to go to /backend/nodeJS
     then relative path will be "/nodeJS"

     where as absolute path will be  " c:/desktop/sharpnener/backend/nodeJS"

     relative --> next to current direcotery
     absolute --> from root to required direcotery

What does createServer do?
    it turns computer into http server
    const server = createServer(requestListner);
    //requestListner listen to request and do something and send response
    requestListner((req,res)=>{
        // do something with req then send response
    })

    server.listen(url or port or ip address)

What are anonymous functions?
 function with no name is anonymous function 
 and it can only be used as callbacks 
 and cant used directly

What do you think server.listens exactly do?Why do we need it?
    server.listen() is like event listner it attach listner to specified port or path on server ;
    and whenever request is made it listen to it ;
